:::info Coming soon

The "Compatible" and "Extended" release tracks will be available in Preview to eligible dbt Cloud accounts in December 2024.

:::

Select the "Compatible" and "Extended" release tracks if you need a less-frequent release cadence, the ability to test new dbt releases before they go live in production, and/or ongoing compatibility with the latest open source releases of dbt Core.

Each monthly "Compatible" release includes functionality matching up-to-date open source versions of dbt Core and adapters at the time of release.

Starting in January 2025, each monthly "Extended" release will match the previous month's "Compatible" release.

For more information, see [release tracks](/docs/dbt-versions/cloud-release-tracks).
